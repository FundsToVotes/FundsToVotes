## Understanding Our Code

We used `create-react-app` to set up our project.

After cloning the repo to your local machine, install the dependencies. To do this, run `npm install`. (This requires that you have Node with npm installed.)

To start your local development server, run `npm start`.

## Contributing

First, clone the repo to your local machine and follow the steps in the previous section. All features and improvements (essentially all commits) should be made on a separate branch (not `main`). Push your commits to a branch, then create a pull request. One team member should review and approve your PR, then it can be merged into the `main` branch.

## Deployment

We are using [Render](https://render.com) for Static Site Hosting. When a PR is merged into `main`, the site automaticall redeploys. Visit the deployed version at [FundsToVotes.info](https://www.fundstovotes.info).

## Backend/Serverside Code

We have a separate (currently private) repository for our backend/serverside code. It is hosted on an Amazon Web Services (AWS) EC2 instance.
