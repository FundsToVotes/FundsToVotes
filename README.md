## Understanding Our Code

We have not yet started coding our app, but we will be developing a single-page React web application. It has been created using `create-react-app`.

After cloning the repo to your local machine, install the dependencies. Ensure your terminal is in the `app` directory, then run `npm install`.

To start your local development server, run `npm start`.

To bundle and build the app for production, run `npm run build`. Please note that we have not established a deployment process, so avoid running this command.

## Contributing

First, clone the repo to your local machine. All features and improvements (essentially all commits) should be made on a separate branch (not `main`). Push your commits to a branch, then create a pull request. One team member should review and approve your PR, then it can be merged into the `main` branch.
